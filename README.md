# Reinforcement-Learning

## Multi Armed Bandit

In this task we will simulate the example of multi-armed bandit presented in the lecture. Note that, differently from the previous topics, Reinforcement Learning is a online method. Therefore we cannot rely on offline datasets. We will, then use simulations.

In this task we will test the $\epsilon$-greed algorithm for MAB.For that, lets simulate the algorithm for different values of $\epsilon$ by keeping the simulation procedure used in this tutorial.
